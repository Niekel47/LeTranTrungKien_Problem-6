# Scoreboard Service Architecture

## Overview
The Scoreboard Service is designed to manage and update user scores in real-time for a competitive environment. This document outlines the architecture of the service, detailing its components, data flow, and interactions with other services.

## Components
1. **API Gateway**: 
   - Acts as the entry point for all client requests.
   - Routes requests to the appropriate service endpoints.

2. **Scoreboard Service**:
   - Responsible for handling score updates and retrieving the top 10 scores.
   - Validates incoming requests to ensure they are authorized.

3. **Database**:
   - Stores user scores and related data.
   - Supports efficient querying to retrieve the top 10 scores.

4. **Authentication Service**:
   - Validates user credentials and issues tokens for authorized actions.
   - Ensures that only authenticated users can update scores.

5. **WebSocket Service**:
   - Facilitates real-time updates to the scoreboard.
   - Notifies clients of score changes as they occur.

## Data Flow
1. A user performs an action that triggers a score update.
2. The client application sends an API request to the API Gateway.
3. The API Gateway forwards the request to the Scoreboard Service.
4. The Scoreboard Service validates the request using the Authentication Service.
5. Upon successful validation, the Scoreboard Service updates the score in the Database.
6. The Scoreboard Service then emits a real-time update via the WebSocket Service to all connected clients.
7. Clients receive the updated scores and refresh the scoreboard display.

## Database Schema
- **Users Table**:
  - `user_id`: Unique identifier for each user.
  - `username`: The name of the user.
  - `score`: The current score of the user.

- **Scores Table** (if needed for historical data):
  - `score_id`: Unique identifier for each score entry.
  - `user_id`: Foreign key linking to the Users table.
  - `score`: The score value.
  - `timestamp`: The time when the score was recorded.

## Third-Party Services
- **Authentication Provider**: Used for user authentication and token management.
- **Real-time Communication Service**: (e.g., Socket.io) for handling WebSocket connections.

## Conclusion
This architecture ensures that the Scoreboard Service is scalable, secure, and capable of providing real-time updates to users. By leveraging a modular approach, each component can be developed and maintained independently, allowing for easier updates and enhancements in the future.
