# Scoreboard Service Documentation

## Overview

The Scoreboard Service is a backend module designed to manage and update user scores in real-time for a scoreboard displayed on a website. This service ensures that the top 10 user scores are always up-to-date and accurately reflect user actions.

## Software Requirements

1. **Scoreboard Display**: The service maintains a scoreboard that shows the top 10 user scores.
2. **Live Updates**: The scoreboard must update in real-time as users complete actions that affect their scores.
3. **User Actions**: Users can perform actions that increase their scores. The specifics of these actions are not within the scope of this module.
4. **API Call for Score Update**: Upon completion of an action, an API call is dispatched to the Scoreboard Service to update the user's score.
5. **Security Measures**: The service implements security protocols to prevent unauthorized score updates, ensuring that only legitimate actions can modify user scores.

## API Usage

### Update Score API

- **Endpoint**: `/api/update-score`
- **Method**: POST
- **Request Body**:
  ```json
  {
    "userId": "string",
    "scoreIncrement": "number"
  }
  ```
- **Response**:
  - **Success**: Returns the updated score and a success message.
  - **Error**: Returns an error message if the update fails due to authorization issues or invalid data.

### Security Measures

To prevent malicious users from increasing scores without authorization, the following measures are implemented:

- **Authentication**: All API calls must include a valid authentication token.
- **Validation**: The service validates the user ID and score increment to ensure they are legitimate.
- **Rate Limiting**: The service implements rate limiting to prevent abuse of the score update endpoint.

## Conclusion

The Scoreboard Service is a critical component of the overall application, ensuring that user scores are accurately maintained and updated in real-time while adhering to strict security protocols. For further details on the architecture and data flow, please refer to the `architecture.md` file.
